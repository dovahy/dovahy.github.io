  						WHAT IS THIS SITE ABOUT?
  						
  					</div>
  					
    				<p>Welcome to my fan site! My name is Florian Swinareck and my website is all about the japanese anime "Wolf's Rain" original created by Nobumoto Keiko. Wolf's Rain was animated by the studio "Bones" with Maseba Yutaka as lead producer. The very first episode aired on January 7th 2003 in Japan on Fuji TV and the last episode aired on July 28 2003. In total of 26 episodes and 4 OVA's. The anime revolves around four lone wolves who cross paths to follow the scent of the Lunar Flower and seeking Paradise. In the dying world of Wolf's Rain exists an ancient legend that when the world ends, the gateway to paradise will be opened. The legend also dictates that only wolves, a species known to be extinct, can find the way to the promised paradise. However those wolves still live among humans, disguising themselves through elaborate illusions. At one point "Kiba", the main protagonist, finds himself drawn to Freeze City through a very special scent. Here Kiba meets "Hige", "Tsume" and "Toboe", who followed the same scent. "Lunar Flowers" are supposed to be the key to opening the door to paradise and those flowers smell brought the wolves to reach the city. Yet not only wolves seek the paradise.. and those with more sinister intentions will do anything in their power to reach it first.
