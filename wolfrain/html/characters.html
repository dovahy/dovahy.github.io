  						KIBA (Fang)
  						
  					</div>

						<p>Kiba "the leader" is a wolf who follows his instincts towards Paradise. When he was young, his pack and family were slaughtered when the forest where he lived was burned to the ground by Jaguara's troops. He was then raised by a shaman who told him that he had a purpose, explaining why the forest had sheltered him from the flames. The shaman told him that he would have a great journey ahead of him, and that journey was to find Paradise. 
						</p>

  					<div class="box1">
  						
  						TSUME (Claw)
  						
  					</div>

						<p>Tsume is a rough, self-reliant wolf. In the past, he was part of a pack. However, one day his pack was attacked by Jaguara's wolf hunting troops and many of his family and friends were killed. During the fight, Tsume attempted to flee, leaving all of his dead and dying brethren behind. Because of this, the rest of the pack cast him out, and the alpha attacked him, leaving him with a large X-shaped scar across his chest. From then on, Tsume was plagued with self-hatred and didn't trust himself to be anyone's friend. For years he did not talk to, get to know, or trust other wolves, and became the leader of a group of human thieves. 
						</p>

  					<div class="box1">
  						
  						HIGE (Whisker)
  						
  					</div>

						<p>Hige seems to know how to function the best in human society. He tends to use his intuition more than the others, but only when he is not thinking with his stomach instead. Hige is something of a womanizer and is always on the look-out for a female companion. 
						</p>

  					<div class="box1">
  						
  						TOBOE (Howling)
  						
  					</div>

						<p>Toboe is the youngest of the group "14 dog years", often acting more like a puppy than a wolf. Toboe was raised as a pet by "Granny", an elderly woman, whom he accidentally killed in an unrestrained act of playfulness. The silver bracelets are all he has left of her. Toboe maintains an affection for humans that none of the other wolves can understand (with the exception of Blue). 
						</p>

  					<div class="box1">
  						
  						CHEZA "The Flower Maiden"
  						
  					</div>

						<p>Cheza is girl who was artificially created from a 'Lunar Flower' by the Noble Darcia the First using the lost art of alchemy. She slept in a bubble, waiting for Kiba, and she was awoken by the smell of wolf's blood. She shares a special bond with the wolves and is the key to finding Paradise. 
						</p>

  					<div class="box1">
  						
  						BLUE
  						
  					</div>

						<p>A wolfdog who was pet to the family of Quent Yaiden. After the destruction of her home and family in the village of Kyrios (Curious), she travels with Quent hunting wolves under the belief that they were responsible for the tragedy. She lives her life as a pet dog, unaware of her wolf bloodline. Upon meeting Cheza, the wolf in her is awakened. 
						</p>

  					<div class="box1">
  						
  						"LORD" DARCIA 
  						
  					</div>

						<p>The third generation of the Darcia family of Nobles, who were said to be cursed after Darcia the First disappeared into "Paradise". Due to his grandfather's curse, Darcia is now plagued with the eye of a wolf. He seeks to use Cheza to somehow revive his lover Hamona, who has been stricken with "Paradise sickness", in which her soul is "taken by Paradise", causing her to fall into a coma.
